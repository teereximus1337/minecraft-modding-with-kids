# Minecraft Modding with Kids

A complete workflow for parents teaching kids to code through Minecraft modding with AI assistance and voice explanations.

## First Run: Onboarding

If no `AGENTS.md` exists in the workspace, run the onboarding flow.

### Step 1: Interview the Parent

Ask 2-3 questions at a time. Gather:

**Batch 1:**
1. Child's first name
2. Child's age
3. Child's reading/complexity level: (A) can't read code at all, (B) can read simple words, (C) reads well but doesn't understand code

**Batch 2:**
4. Child's Minecraft experience: creative mode only / survival / both
5. What would excite the kid most for a first mod? (custom sword, funny TNT, new animal, something else)
6. Any content to avoid? (realistic weapons, scary mobs, etc.)

**Batch 3:**
7. Parent's coding experience: none / understands basics / experienced developer
8. ElevenLabs API key (required -- explain: "This lets the AI talk to your kid out loud so they don't need to read scrolling code. Get a key at elevenlabs.io > Profile > API Keys")
9. ElevenLabs voice ID (or "default" to use a standard voice -- they can browse voices at elevenlabs.io/voice-library)

### Step 2: Derive Configuration

From the answers, generate these values:
- `CHILD_NAME`: from answer 1
- `CHILD_AGE`: from answer 2
- `READING_LEVEL`: none / basic / intermediate (from answer 3)
- `MOD_ID`: lowercase, no spaces, derived from child's name (e.g., "gus" → "gusmods")
- `MOD_DISPLAY_NAME`: e.g., "Gus's Awesome Mods"
- `PARENT_EXPERIENCE`: none / basic / experienced
- `CONTENT_GUIDELINES`: generated from answer 6
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: from answer 8
- `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`: from answer 9
- `EXPLANATION_DEPTH`: derived from age + reading level:
  - Age 4-5 or reading=none: 3-5 sentences, zero jargon, pure analogies
  - Age 6-8 or reading=basic: 5-8 sentences, introduce "rules" and "numbers" concepts
  - Age 9-12 or reading=intermediate: 8-12 sentences, use simplified code terminology

### Step 3: Environment Setup

Run `scripts/onboard.sh` with the derived MOD_ID. This script:
1. Checks OS (macOS or Linux)
2. Installs JDK 21 (Homebrew on Mac, apt on Linux)
3. Installs deno (for Fabric CLI)
4. Generates a Fabric mod project via `deno run -A https://fabricmc.net/cli init <MOD_ID> -y`
5. Builds the project once (`./gradlew build`)
6. Initializes git

If any step fails, show the error and ask the parent to fix it before continuing.

### Step 4: Extract Class Mappings

Run `scripts/extract-mappings.sh` inside the mod project. This:
1. Runs `./gradlew genSources` to decompile Minecraft 1.21.11
2. Finds the sources JAR in `.gradle/loom-cache/`
3. Extracts all key class names and writes them to a reference file

The bundled `references/class-mappings-1.21.11.md` is a fallback if extraction fails.

### Step 5: Generate Workspace Files

Run `scripts/generate-workspace.sh` with a JSON config of all interview answers. This creates:
- `AGENTS.md` in the workspace root (from `assets/agents-md-template.md`)
- Agent rules in `.cursor/rules/` (from `assets/rules/` templates) -- or equivalent for other agents
- An `audio/` directory for voice output
- A `.gitignore` covering build artifacts, audio output, and secrets

### Step 6: Configure ElevenLabs MCP

Detect the agent type and add the ElevenLabs MCP server config:

**Cursor** (`.cursor/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "elevenlabs": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": ["elevenlabs-mcp"],
    "env": {
      "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "{{KEY}}",
      "ELEVENLABS_MCP_BASE_PATH": "{{WORKSPACE}}/audio",
      "ELEVENLABS_MCP_OUTPUT_MODE": "files"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code** (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ElevenLabs": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["elevenlabs-mcp"],
      "env": { "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY": "{{KEY}}" }
    }
  }
}
```

For other agents, print the config and ask the parent to paste it into the appropriate file.

### Step 7: Create Starter Mod

Generate a simple first item (a custom sword or tool based on answer 5) so the child sees something immediately in their first session. Include all required files: Java class, registration, model JSON, client item JSON, lang entry, and a placeholder texture.

Build it, launch Minecraft, and celebrate.

## Session Modes

### Mode: Session Start

Triggered when parent says "session time", "let's build", "[child name] is here", or starts a new conversation.

1. Determine phase: prep (parent solo) or build (child present)
2. If **prep**: scaffold boilerplate, get things compiling, leave fun decisions for the child
3. If **build**: ask what to build, generate voice explanation of the plan, then code

### Mode: Active Development

Triggered on any mod-related request. STRICT order:

1. **Voice explanation FIRST**: Generate a child-friendly audio explanation of the plan via ElevenLabs `text_to_speech`, then play it with `open <file>.mp3` (macOS) or `xdg-open <file>.mp3` (Linux). The child listens while code is being written.
2. **Code changes**: Write/edit Java, JSON, resource files. ALWAYS consult `references/class-mappings-1.21.11.md` before writing imports.
3. **Build**: `./gradlew build`
4. **Launch Minecraft**: Kill old instances first, then `./gradlew runClient`. ALWAYS the last step.

Never reorder these steps. Never skip the voice explanation when the child is present.

### Mode: Debugging

When something doesn't work:
1. Frame it as a puzzle for the child, not a failure: "The computer got confused! Let's figure out why."
2. Check logs for errors
3. Consult `references/class-mappings-1.21.11.md` for wrong class names
4. Explain the bug and fix to the child via voice

## Voice Explanation Rules

See `references/voice-explanation-guide.md` for full details. Key rules:

- Speak BEFORE coding (child listens while code is written)
- Start with the plan: what are we building and what will it do in-game?
- Teach code logic: numbers control things, order matters, IF/THEN gates, loops repeat
- Scale complexity to child's age and reading level (from `EXPLANATION_DEPTH`)
- Conversational tone: vary greetings, reference what the child said, end with excitement
- Use ElevenLabs `text_to_speech` tool with the configured voice_id and model `eleven_flash_v2_5`

---

## Code Generation Rules

See `references/fabric-patterns.md` and `references/class-mappings-1.21.11.md`. Key rules:

- **ALWAYS check class-mappings before writing imports.** AI training data has wrong names for 1.21.11.
- `SwordItem` does not exist. Use `Item` with `.sword()` on Properties.
- `ResourceLocation` does not exist. Use `Identifier`.
- `hurtEnemy()` returns void, not boolean.
- `inventoryTick` takes `(ItemStack, ServerLevel, Entity, @Nullable EquipmentSlot)` -- use `player.getMainHandItem() == stack` instead of checking the slot parameter.
- Block interactions need BOTH `useWithoutItem` AND `useItemOn` overrides to work whether the player is holding an item or not.
- Generate ALL required files for every new item/block (Java, registration, model, client item, lang, texture). Never leave partial implementations.
- Use fun, descriptive names the child would recognize.
